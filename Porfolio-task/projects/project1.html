    <p>Develop a simple note-taking application using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete notes. The detailed requirements are as follows:</p>

<h4>Backend (FastAPI):
1. User Authentication:
   - Implement user registration and login.
   - Use JWT tokens for secure authentication.
2. CRUD Operations for Notes:
   - Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
   - Each note should be associated with a user.
3. Database:
   - Use MongoDB to store user and note data.</h4>

<h4>Frontend (React):
1. User Interface:
   - A simple interface for note creation, editing, and deletion.
   - Display a list of notes created by the user.
2. User Authentication:
   - Integrate with the backend authentication system.
   - Handle user sessions and token management.
3. Styling:
   - Apply basic CSS for styling the application.</h4>

<h4>Steps to Follow:
1. Backend Setup:
   - Create a FastAPI project.
   - Implement models for User and Note.
   - Set up endpoints for user registration, login, and note CRUD operations.
   - Use MongoDB with a library like Motor or PyMongo.
2. Frontend Setup:
   - Create a React project.
   - Develop components for user registration, login, and note management.
   - Use fetch or axios to interact with the backend API.
3. Authentication:
   - Implement JWT token handling in the frontend.
   - Secure routes that require authentication.
4. Basic Styling:
   - Use simple CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the application.</h4>
